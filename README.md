# Skyblock-Auctions-Bot
Things it does, 
1. Live Auction Checker [parse by username(in game)]
2. Lowest Bin lookup [not as functional]
3. Bazaar Prices lookup [works for the most part]
# redundant things
1. user input sky shiiyu profile
2. myah command [doesnt really work unless your discord username is your in game username ]
That is all. 
Simple? no, Stupid bot.
Okay have fun or smt idk.
